### Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a pull request, please ensure:

- You have read and followed the Pull Request Template.
- Your branch is up-to-date with the `main` branch of this repository.
- Your code adheres to the project's Code Style.
- All existing tests pass, and new tests are added for new features or bug fixes.
- Your commit messages are clear and follow the Commit Messages guidelines.
- The PR description clearly explains the problem your PR solves and how it solves it.

## Development Setup

After cloning the repository and running `npm install`, the pre-commit hooks (managed by Husky and lint-staged) will be automatically set up. This ensures that your code is linted and formatted before every commit.

## Code Style

This project enforces code style using ESLint and Prettier.

- `npm run lint`: Checks for linting errors.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes fixable linting errors.
- `npm run lint:md:fix`: Automatically fixes fixable linting errors in Markdown files.
- `npm run format`: Checks for formatting issues.
- `npm run format:fix`: Automatically formats files.
- `npm run format:md:fix`: Automatically formats Markdown files.

Pre-commit hooks will automatically run `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` on staged files.

## Testing

Tests are written using Jest.

- `npm test`: Runs all tests.

Please ensure all existing tests pass before submitting a pull request. If you are adding new features or fixing bugs, please include new tests to cover your changes.

## Commit Messages

This project uses **Conventional Commits**, which is the foundation for our automated release process. Your commit messages are automatically parsed to determine the next version number and generate changelog notes.

Please follow this specification. The `commitlint` hook will prevent non-compliant messages.

### How Commit Types Affect Releases

- **`feat:`**: A commit of this type indicates a new feature has been added. This will trigger a **minor** version bump (e.g., `1.2.3` -> `1.3.0`).
- **`fix:`**: A commit of this type indicates a bug fix. This will trigger a **patch** version bump (e.g., `1.2.3` -> `1.2.4`).
- **`BREAKING CHANGE:`**: A commit that has `BREAKING CHANGE:` in its body or footer indicates a major, incompatible change. This will trigger a **major** version bump (e.g., `1.2.3` -> `2.0.0`).
- **Other types** (`docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `test:`): These commits will be included in the release notes but **will not** trigger a release on their own.

**Example of a breaking change commit:**
```
feat: remove deprecated `getUser` method

BREAKING CHANGE: The `getUser` method has been removed. Please use `fetchUser` instead.
```
