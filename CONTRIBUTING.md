## Development Setup

After cloning the repository and running `npm install`, the pre-commit hooks (managed by Husky and lint-staged) will be automatically set up. This ensures that your code is linted and formatted before every commit.

## Code Style

This project enforces code style using ESLint and Prettier.

- `npm run lint`: Checks for linting errors.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes fixable linting errors.
- `npm run lint:md:fix`: Automatically fixes fixable linting errors in Markdown files.
- `npm run format`: Checks for formatting issues.
- `npm run format:fix`: Automatically formats files.
- `npm run format:md:fix`: Automatically formats Markdown files.

Pre-commit hooks will automatically run `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` on staged files.

## Testing

Tests are written using Jest.

- `npm test`: Runs all tests.

Please ensure all existing tests pass before submitting a pull request. If you are adding new features or fixing bugs, please include new tests to cover your changes.

## Commit Messages

We encourage the use of Conventional Commits for clear and consistent commit history. Examples:

- `feat: Add new feature for X`
